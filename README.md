# ThunderBots Robot Controller
## Introduction
This is the robot controller code for team 22064 for this season, _Into the Deep_.
Our robot "Linguine-Marinara" is an amazing bot with some awesome features.

## For Drivers
Drivers, a dedicated file has been made for you regarding a guide to get started [Driver Quick Start Guide](DriverHelp.md).

## Robot Setup
To setup the robot the hardware must be properly mapped, please view the [Hardware Configuration Guide](Configuration.md).

## Code
Our code is contained within the TeamCode folder.
This year we decided to move back from Command-Based coding with FTC lib and re-explore traditional FTC programming.
This will allow us to improve cooperation since few teams use Command-Based code.

## Uploading Code
To upload new code to the robot simply go to Android Studio, pull in the code needed, plug a programming cable into the robot, and then press the green start button in Android Studio.
