# Driver Help
## Introduction
Hello drivers!! This document serves as a quickstart to your driving experience.
It outlines how the controller actually controls the robot.

## For both drivers
Both drivers must connect their controllers,
when the controllers are connected press Start + (A/B)
A if you're the drivetrain driver,
B if you're the control surface driver.

## Drivetrain (Gamepad 1)
As the drivetrain driver you will control the robot's drivetrain
AKA its wheels!

Here are your controls:
- Left joystick vertical (up/down) - Moves the robot forward and backward
- Right joystick horizontal (left/right) - Moves the robot side to side
- 'Y' - When y is held the robot will enter slow mode halving its speed for precise movements
- Left trigger - Turns the robot counterclockwise
- Right trigger - Turns the robot clockwise
- Pressing both bumpers - Switches between field-oriented and robot-oriented mode
  - In field-oriented mode movements are all relative to you so if you push up on your left joystick it moves the robot away from you
- 'B' (Field-Oriented Only) - Field-oriented relies on the heading of the robot to work, if the heading is incorrect the mode will not work properly and you'll notice weird movement, to fix this rotate the robot until the FRONT FACES AWAY from you using triggers and then press 'B' to reset the IMU
That's all!!

## Control Surfaces (Gamepad 2)
As the control surfaces driver (I like to say engineer) you control all of the robots extra surfaces.
These include the arm + hand and hook.

Here are your controls:
- 'Y'/'A' - When held moves the hook up/down
- Right joystick vertical (up/down) - Moves the viper slide up/down
- Left joystick vertical (up/down) - Moves the wrist down/up (Note that joystick up does move the wrist down)
- Right trigger - Closes the claw
- Left trigger - Opens the claw
